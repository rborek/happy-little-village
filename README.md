#Happy Little Village
Happy Little Village is a game for Android made using Java and libGDX. Originally created during Global Game Jam 2016, it was later released on the Google Play Store.

#Building and running

#How to play
Click and hold down to pick up ritual recipes, then drag them to the altar and release to place gems. Press the green button to commence the ritual, and the red button to clear the altar. Click and drag horizontally to scroll through your available rituals.

By completing rituals before the week's end, you gain black gems, which are used to unlock new rituals. If you fail to complete the weekly ritual within 7 days of receiving it, your village will be destroyed and the game will end.
